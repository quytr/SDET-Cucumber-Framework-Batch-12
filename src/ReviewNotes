In feature, what we can see is Gherkin language that has:
given - precondition
when - action
then - expected results
and - continuation step
but -

background - common steps for precondition that we use in the particular feature file

Feature: is a functionality we are testing
    Scenario
    Scenario Outline with Examples - use for Data Driven Testing that we can run more than one tests
        Data Driven Testing - execute test case across multiple data set

Step Definition:
    Implementation code using Java and add verification/assertion using JUnit
    Hooks: provide precondition and post condition to all scenarios. We always create hooks class in steps package.
        @Before - precondition
        @After - post condition

Runner:
    Using JUnit to run cucumber scenarios
        Cucumber Options:
        glue -
        dryRun - where we find implementations step
        monochrome - avoid irrelevant information
        tags - for grouping reports - path to our feature we are running

Maven: a build automation tool
    - We can manage the dependencies
    - pom file (pom.xml) - project object model to define our dependencies:
        1. Cucumber (Java, JUnit)
        2. Unit
        3. Selenium
        4. Apache poi etc...
    - To find the dependencies we go to maven repository.
    - Maven has 3 repositories:
        1. central - https://www.mvnrepository.com/
        2. remote - company repository (more security) they download from central repo and more security
        3. local - .M2 directory that has all the jar files

resources:
    - config -
    - features -
    - test data -
